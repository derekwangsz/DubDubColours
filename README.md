# DubDubColours

DubDubColours is an app that celebrates colours and new WWDC22 Shadow and Text Animation APIs ðŸ¥³

Basically, the new Shadow API allows us to create shadow around any view with a radius and/or even a colour.
SwiftUI also now allows for text animations, and they act like the Magic Move we see in KeyNote.
SwiftUI automatically animates between different lengthed texts and can even animate bolden and italicized texts!

Enjoy!
